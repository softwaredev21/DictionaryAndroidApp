## About
The concept was to make a dictionary where the user doesn't have to close the application where he currently is to get a word's definition.

Therefore, the idea was implemented using Android's clipboard tools and the Wiktionary's API. This way, the only thing the user has to do is copy the word, and a notification will pop up with the definition.
A click on the notification will present other definitions.

There's also the option for a more tradiotional approach where you can simply open the app and look for the word you're looking for in a clean and direct design.

Since it's based on the Wiktionary's API, it supports dozens of languages in a 2MB app.
